        <h4>Why did this battle happen?</h4>
        <p>When King Edward the Confessor died he left no true heir to the throne. This caused many people to claim the throne as their own. <br> That is when two main people when and fought for the throne. After Harold was crowned, and William got word that he was, William raised an army to go claim his right to the throne.</p>

        <p>King Edward the Confessor's first cousin once removed, this along with the fact that William claimed Harold told him he was the heir to the throne gave him a reason to fight Harold for the throne.</p>
